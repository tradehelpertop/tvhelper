### Overview

TradingView Helper (Tvhelper) aims to enhance the functionality of TradingView in various ways, making it more convenient for users to utilize the platform.   
Currently, Tvhelper offers three main features.

##### 1. Display the turnover of each candlestick

Typically, TradingView only shows the volume of each candlestick, but Tvhelper can help you display the trading value for each candlestick.  

##### 2. Display the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies on the corresponding date of each candlestick

When you hover your mouse over different candlesticks, Tvhelper can show the circulating market capitalization of the cryptocurrency on the corresponding date of that candlestick.    
Currently, Tvhelper supports displaying historical market capitalization for approximately one year. Longer historical data will be added in future updates.  

##### 3. Display the 1-hour candlestick chart for each daily candlestick

In the daily chart, when the mouse is hovering over a daily candlestick, pressing the Ctrl key will display the corresponding 1-hour candlestick chart for that day.  
This makes it easier to view the 1-hour candlesticks that make up the daily candlestick.

### How to pay

#### 1. Overview

Tvhelper offers a 1-year free trial for new users. After that, a paid subscription is required.   
At the moment, payments can only be made through Binance Pay, and only USDT is accepted.  

**Price:**  
Currently, there is only one membership type, which costs USD 2.99 per month. Each payment must be exactly $2.99; other amounts will be ignored.  

**Note:**   
1\. The maximum membership period a user can purchase is 6 months. Any excess beyond 6 months will not be effective.   

For example:    
- If you pay seven times $2.99, your membership will still only be extended by 6 months.  
- If your membership has 5 months remaining and you pay for 2 more months ($2.99 each), only 1 extra month will be added, and the second month will not take effect.  

2\.  Please note, payments are non-refundable, so make sure to purchase carefully.
